## Daily Log

Lightweight daily engineering log for tracking changes, decisions, and observations.
This is intentionally low ceremony. One entry per day is enough.

### 2026-01-01
**Focus**
- Migrate application hosting from AKS to Azure App Service to reduce costs.

**What changed**
- Deployed Node.js app to Azure App Service (Linux, B1).
- Implemented GitHub Actions CI/CD using Azure OIDC (no secrets).
- Enabled OpenTelemetry with Azure Monitor / Application Insights.
- Verified traces, logs, metrics, and exceptions are flowing.
- Added health check (`/healthz`) and smoke test in CI.
- Added owner/environment tagging to Azure resources.

**Decisions**
- Chose App Service over AKS for lower operational and cost overhead.
- Kept OpenTelemetry setup application-side for portability.
- Used zip deploy via GitHub Actions to avoid proxy-related issues.

**Observations**
- Corporate proxy breaks Azure CLI zip deploy locally.
- GitHub Actions avoids this entirely.
- App Service + OTel provides sufficient observability for this workload.

**Next**
- Lock resource group to prevent accidental deletion.
- Archive old AKS/Helm artifacts.
- Optional: add availability test in Application Insights.
