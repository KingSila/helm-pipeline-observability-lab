# Helm Pipeline Observability Lab

Learning project focused on:
- Helm-based Kubernetes deployments
- CI/CD pipelines across multiple environments
- Monitoring and observability using Azure Monitor and Application Insights

## High-level flow
1. Build a simple application
2. Package and deploy it to Kubernetes using Helm
3. Promote releases via CI/CD pipelines (dev → qa → prod)
4. Collect logs, metrics, and traces in Azure Monitor
5. Use Live Metrics to observe deployments in real time

This repo is intentionally minimal and evolves step by step.
